## SCADA system
A SCADA system is used by a power plant operator to ensure safe operation. The temperature of the air inside the chamber and the rotational speed of the turbine are both continuously monitored by the system. It shuts down the machine if either the turbine speed or the temperature in the combustion chamber exceeds the safe operating range. Be aware that a power plant, like the majority of industrial facilities, cannot be shut down suddenly. This system performs a controlled shutdown, as that is exactly is required.
